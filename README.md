# Tiles Game

[![CI status](https://github.com/baldoalessandro/tiles_game/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/baldoalessandro/tiles_games/actions)

A clone of NYT Tiles game in SolidJS.

## Why

I needed a small project to experiment with SolidJS and its ecosystem . Things can be either experimental or artificially over-engineered for learning purpose.

## Reference

For the real game go to https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/tiles and consider get a subscription there, is definitely worth the money!
